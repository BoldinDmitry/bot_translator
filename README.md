This project use Python implementation for the Telegram Bor API and also Yandex Speech API.
Bot has two parts. 

The first part is simple bot, where you can change language to wich yout message will be translated. The second part is inline telegram bot. If you want to send something to your friend, who does not speak on your language, just change translation language, and then send message through the inline bot to translate it.

Bot isn't working at the moment, but you can run it on your own server.
